jekyll picture tag: https://www.elstudio.us/code/use-any-jekyll-plugin-with-github-pages , https://rbuchberger.github.io/jekyll_picture_tag/users/installation.html

I tried to implement Jekyll Picture Tag (jpt), and I used GitHub Actions to deploy instead of 'Deploy from a branch'. However, I got an [error during build](https://github.com/blpdelivery/rounds/actions/runs/15313480034/job/43082856038).


TODO: test on various browsers (browserling) and make it work without js (esp. atom feed copier)
